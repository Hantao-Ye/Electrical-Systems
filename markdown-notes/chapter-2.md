## Kirchhoff's Law

### Definitions of Items

- Branch: flowing the same current
- Node: a point where two ore more elements meet
- Path: branches from node A to B
- Loop: closed path
- Mesh

### Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

The **algebraic sum** of all currents at any node in a circuit equals 0

$$
\sum{I} = 0\qquad +(\text{the leaving current}) \qquad -(\text{the entering current})
$$

And it could be expressed as the another form

$$
\sum{\text{Current entering a node}} = \sum{\text{Current leaving a node}}
$$

> The **algebraic sum** of all currents at any ***closed boundary*** equals 0

### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

The **algebraic sum** of all voltages around any closed path in a circuit equals 0

$$
\sum{V} = 0\qquad +(\text{the dropping voltage}) \qquad -(\text{the rising voltage})
$$

And it could be expressed as the another form

$$
\sum{\text{Voltage drop}} = \sum{\text{Voltage rise}}
$$
